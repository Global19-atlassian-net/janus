## Introduction

The nextstrain project is an attempt to make flexible informatic pipelines and visualization tools to track ongoing pathogen evolution as sequence data emerges. The nextstrain project derives from [nextflu](https://github.com/blab/nextflu), which was specific to influenza evolution.

nextstrain is comprised of four components:

* [fauna](https://github.com/nextstrain/fauna): database and IO scripts for sequence and serological data
* [augur](https://github.com/nextstrain/augur): informatic pipelines to conduct inferences from raw data
* [auspice](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice): web app to visualize resulting inferences
* [janus](https://github.com/nextstrain/janus): build and deploy scripts

## Janus

*Definition: Roman god of beginnings and passages.*

This repo is intended to ease deployment of nextstrain instances. It's goal is to provide deploy scripts for augur builds.

## Docker commands

Build base Docker image

    docker build -t nextstrain/base:latest -f Dockerfile.base .

Push base image to hub

    docker push nextstrain/base:latest

Build janus Docker image

    docker build -t nextstrain/janus:latest .

Push janus image to hub

    docker push nextstrain/janus:latest

Run a shell from within the container

    docker run -t -i nextstrain/janus /bin/bash

Run a shell from within the container, including environment variables

    docker run -t -i --env-file environment_janus.env nextstrain/janus /bin/bash

## Testing

Enter shell

    docker run -t -i --env-file environment_janus.env nextstrain/janus /bin/bash

Build Zika

    python build.py

## Building with Snakemake

Export rethinkdb environment variables and load Anaconda environment.

```bash
. environment_rethink.sh

source activate janus_python3
```

Configure which viruses, lineages, and resolutions to build in
`config.json`. Perform a dry-run of the builds by printing the commands that
will be executed for the configuration.

```bash
snakemake -npq
```

If everything looks good, run builds on the cluster. For example, the following
command runs no more than 4 builds at a time.

```bash
snakemake -w 30 -j 4 --cluster-config cluster.json --cluster "sbatch --nodes=1 --ntasks=1 --mem={cluster.memory} --cpus-per-task={cluster.cores} --tmp={cluster.disk} --time={cluster.time} --job-name='{cluster.name}' --output='{cluster.stdout}' --error='{cluster.stderr}'"
```
