## Introduction

The nextstrain project is an attempt to make flexible informatic pipelines and visualization tools to track ongoing pathogen evolution as sequence data emerges. The nextstrain project derives from [nextflu](https://github.com/blab/nextflu), which was specific to influenza evolution.

nextstrain is comprised of four components:

* [fauna](https://github.com/nextstrain/fauna): database and IO scripts for sequence and serological data
* [augur](https://github.com/nextstrain/augur): informatic pipelines to conduct inferences from raw data
* [auspice](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice): web app to visualize resulting inferences
* [janus](https://github.com/nextstrain/janus): build and deploy scripts

## Janus

*Definition: Roman god of beginnings and passages.*

This repo is intended to ease deployment of nextstrain instances. It's goal is to provide deploy scripts for augur builds.

## Docker commands

Build base Docker image

    docker build -t nextstrain/base:latest -f Dockerfile.base .

Push base image to hub

    docker push nextstrain/base:latest

Build janus Docker image

    docker build -t nextstrain/janus:latest .

Push janus image to hub

    docker push nextstrain/janus:latest

Run a shell from within the container

    docker run -t -i nextstrain/janus /bin/bash

Run a shell from within the container, including environment variables

    docker run -t -i --env-file environment_janus.env nextstrain/janus /bin/bash

## Testing

Enter shell

    docker run -t -i --env-file environment_janus.env nextstrain/janus /bin/bash

Build Zika

    python build.py

## Building with Snakemake

### Installation

Download and install miniconda.

```bash
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Setup the Anaconda environments.

```bash
conda env create -f anaconda.augur.yaml
conda env create -f anaconda.python3.yaml
```

Create symlinks for binaries with non-standard names.

```bash
export CONDA_BIN_DIR=$(dirname `which conda`)
ln -s ${CONDA_BIN_DIR}/raxmlHPC ${CONDA_BIN_DIR}/raxml
ln -s ${CONDA_BIN_DIR}/FastTree ${CONDA_BIN_DIR}/fasttree
```

### Usage

Export rethinkdb environment variables and load Anaconda environment.

```bash
. environment_rethink.sh
source activate janus_python3
```

Configure which viruses, lineages, and resolutions to build in
`config.json`. Perform a dry-run of the builds by printing the commands that
will be executed for the configuration.

```bash
snakemake -npq
```

If everything looks good, run builds on the cluster. For example, the following
command runs no more than 4 builds at a time.

```bash
snakemake -w 30 -j 4 --cluster-config cluster.json --cluster "sbatch --nodes=1 --ntasks=1 --mem={cluster.memory} --cpus-per-task={cluster.cores} --tmp={cluster.disk} --time={cluster.time} --job-name='{cluster.name}' --output='{cluster.stdout}' --error='{cluster.stderr}'"
```

Alternately, jobs can be submitted using the DRMAA interface as follows.

```bash
snakemake -w 30 -j 4 --cluster-config cluster.json --drmaa " --nodes=1 --ntasks=1 --mem={cluster.memory} --cpus-per-task={cluster.cores} --tmp={cluster.disk} --time={cluster.time}" --jobname "{rulename}.{jobid}.sh"
```

By default, all augur builds defined in `config["builds"]` will be built locally
and not synced to S3. Use the `push` rule to build one or more specific viruses
and push them to S3. Note that the AWS CLI expects credentials to be defined in
`~/.aws/credentials` under the profile `nextstrain`.

The following command builds seasonal flu, Zika, and Ebola files, pushes the
corresponding auspice output to the development data bucket on S3, and creates
an invalidation request for the corresponding development CloudFront
account. The `cloudfront` argument can be omitted to only push files to S3 for
testing.

```bash
# Build all flu, zika, and ebola sites and push their JSONs to the development
# S3 bucket.
snakemake push --config builds="flu,zika,ebola" s3_bucket=nextstrain-dev-data cloudfront=dev
```

Use the `clean` rule to delete prepared, processed, and auspice files from one
or more builds.

```bash
snakemake clean --config builds="flu,zika,ebola"
```
